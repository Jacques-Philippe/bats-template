# Getting started (dev)
```
git clone https://github.com/Jacques-Philippe/bats-template.git --recursive your-project-name
```

# Purpose

This project will serve as a template for making bash scripts.

# Context

More and more I'm making repos that are reusing certain helper bash scripts, so I thought it might be a good idea to make those scripts into submodules and to import them in the future. While I'm at it, I thought, why not implement testing in my bash scripts?
This brought me neatly to `bats`, the testing library for `bash`.

I got information for this topic from [here](https://bats-core.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html)
